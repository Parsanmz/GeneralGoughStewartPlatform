# Gough-Stewart Platform FKP and IKP
FKP and IKP formulation and numerical solution of a Simple 6-DoF Gough-Stewart Platform

In this project, I am going to derive the Inverse and Forward Kinematics equations of the-so-called Gough-Stewart platform, which has 6 degrees-of-freedom. The platform is a parallel robot consisted of 6 linear actuators and two plates, as the base and end-effector. First, a closed-form inverse kinematics formulation will be suggested. Based on the IKP equations, a numerical solution will be performed on the robot to achieve an answer to the FKP. Afterwards, the jacobian matrix of the robot will be derived. **Note that everything will be verified here using MATLAB Simulink, so we will be sure that our models work.**
